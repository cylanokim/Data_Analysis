1. the more shelf space they give a product, the more they'll sell
given {a data set of different stores that have varying shelf sizes for different product types
and the amount of sales each store} 

use {Linear Regression}

to {calculate beta, product sales change as shelf size they give to a product change,
the degree of change in the product sales for every 1-unit of change in the shelf space size the retailer give to a product}

2. Determine which two or more products could be considered as complementary 
As mentioned in the lecture, cereal and milk seem obviously somplementary. However, some products
are less obvious. 

2-1. linear regression
given {sales history}
use {Linear regression, Pearson Correalation Coefficient, confusion matrix}
to {determine which products should be considered complementary} 

2-2. Bayesian statistics 
given {sales history}
use {bayesian network}
to

3. If two complementary product types are next to each other on the shelves, then the complementary effects form
(2) will be even greater  
given( {products distance (if more than two-->average distances) and sales history}
use {Linear Regression} 
to {calculate Pearson correlation coefficient}
